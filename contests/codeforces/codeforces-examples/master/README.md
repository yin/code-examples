Codeforces-examples
===================

**DISCLAIMER:** I provide no solutions to codeforces problems here and thus I do not
wilate anything for anyone.

Here I provide my tools I use for codeforces.com. I include:

- A python solution scrubber - given contest problem code (e.g.: 460A) and downloads
source code of solutions, which are available online on the site.

- A shell problem downloader - downloads contest problem description and converts
complete page to PDF

Usage and setup
===============

I keep the downloaded data in an Dropbox directory. The problem descriptions,
test sets and other codeforces stuff is public, but it is also copyrighted!

You will need the following...

For problem downloader:
1. wget
2. wkhtmltopdf

    ./tools/problem-contest.sh 460{A,B,C,D,E}

For solution scrubber:
1. Python
2. Mechanize

    ./tools/solution-contest.py 460A
