Codeforces-examples
===================

This is a place with some coding examples I did on codeforces problems. I also
included tools I used for learning:

- A python solution scrubber, which looks up tested solutions on the website
and downloads the code. For now only accepted solutions and olny source code are
downloaded. Requires some python-libs on your system, like mechanize.

- A shell Problem downloader script, which downloads a problem description as
complete page and optionaly creates a PDF and archives the page in .tar.gz. Uses
wget and wkhtmltopdf for PDF conversion.

Usage and setup
===============

You need the folowing to build the tools in this repository:

1. VirtualEnv for Python

I keep the downloaded data in an Dropbox directory. The problem descriptions,
test sets and other codeforces stuff is public, but it is also copyrighted!
