    <h1>Dart examples</h1>
    
    <p>This site is an example of different features of the Dart language. I
    put it together as an excercise while learning Dart. Dart is not only a
    languge, it's a platform and developement tool-chain. Partially the next
    evolutionary stage of Google Web Toolkit (GWT), Dart is also meant an
    ambitious replacement for JavaScript, the standing Web programming
    langauge.</p>
    <p>All pages including the home include all kind of features and effects
    implemented in Dart. To name few: Hiding sections enhancing usability,
    animations dramatizing algorithm inner working and simple toys and easter
    eggs. The point of this site is to explore dart and all it's features.
    Additionally, the code is meant to be read much as examples are. The code
    should is written in a particular style, noticable hrough the axamples.</p>

      <dd>.</dd>
      <dt>List&lt;T&gt; trhows RangeError</dt>
      <dd>Use add() method to add elements. A list can be indexed only for
