    <h1>Dart examples</h1>

    <p>This site is an example of different features of the Dart language. I
    put it together as an excercise while learning Dart. Dart is not only a
    languge, it's a platform and developement tool-chain. Partially the next
    evolutionary stage of Google Web Toolkit (GWT), Dart is also meant an
    ambitious replacement for JavaScript, the standing Web programming
    langauge.</p>
    <p>All pages including the home include all kind of features and effects
    implemented in Dart. To name few: Hiding sections enhancing usability,
    animations dramatizing algorithm inner working and simple toys and easter
    eggs. The point of this site is to explore dart and all it's features.
    Additionally, the code is meant to be read much as examples are. The code
    should is written in a particular style, noticable hrough the axamples.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>#symbols</li>
          <li>{optional, function, arguments}</li>
          <li>Named.constructors()</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Dart has no arrays</dt>
      <dd>There is Iterable class, Collection extends it. Set, List and Queue
      <dt>Constructing a List&lt;T&gt;</dt>
      <dd>.</dd>
      <dt>List&lt;T&gt; trhows RangeError</dt>
      <dd>Use add() method to add elements. A list can be indexed only for
      reading or setting items, not to add new items.</dd>
      <dt>Construction(a, b) : initializers = a, list = b { /**/ }</dt>
      <dd>Final fields have to be initialized before constructor body
      executes. This is achieved using constructor initialize, which are put
      after semicolon just before constructor body.</dd>
      <dt>Unit testing framework</dt>
      <dd>For writing unit tests, there is the unittest package, which can be
      put into dev_dependencies in pubspec.yaml file. Tests are defined using
      the test() method taking test name and test function as parameter. The
      test() methods are called from main() function and for browser apps the
      test script is included into a blank html page, which will be filled with
      test results.</dd>
      <dt>Expectation matchers</dt>
      <dd>Expectations in tests are modelled similarly to hamcrest matchers in
      Java. There's plenty of expectation matchers.</dd>
      <dt>Test PASS, FAIL and ERROR</dt>
      <dd>A test can PASS, or FAIL the expectations. Alternativelly, if an
      exception is thrown during test execution, the test can result in ERROR.</dd>
    </ul>
