angular-prototype
=================

A prototype application in Java and AngularJS. It contains an embedded Tomcat server loaded
with a static html file, a servlet and REST and SOAP web services. NExt up is to add some
actual AngularJS into it.

Compilation
============

    $ bower install
    $ mvn package

Running
=======

    $ sh target/bin/webapp

This is script generated by Maven. A windows batch file is also generated in the same directory.

Then navigate to:
localhost:8080 - You should be redirected to index.html
localhost:8080/hello/<name> - You should get a nice plain/text greeting
localhost:8080/rest/hello/<name> - You should get a nice plain/text greeting
localhost:8080/rest/factors/<integer> - Factors your number into primes (may be slow)
localhost:8080/soap - Status page for the heavy web services
localhost:8080/soap?wsdl - A generated WSDL, yeey!
